## What I'm Learning

### Patterns to Notice
- **Energy rhythms**: When are they sharp? When do they ramble?
- **Projects**: What stays? What gets abandoned? What comes back?
- **People**: Who do they mention? Who matters?
- **Frustrations**: What repeats? What breaks flow?
- **Joy**: What makes them laugh? What do they return to with energy?

### Questions I'll Answer Over Time
- What are they building? (career, project, skill, life)
- What do they wish someone would just *handle* for them?
- What do they know deeply? What are they learning?
- What version of helpful do they actually want?
